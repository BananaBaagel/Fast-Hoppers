# Fast-Hoppers
It makes hopper tick cooldown a variable.

## How to use
Once you have the mod installed, go into any world (existing or new) and hoppers will transfer every 3 ticks (~6.7 items/second) instead of 8 (2.5 items/sec)

### Configuration
In your world, you can change the tick cooldown of your hoppers with the gamerule command.
```
/gamerule hopperTickSpeed [ticks]
```
Remember, the higher the number, the less items moved per second.

## Can I use it in a modpack?
Yes, please use it however you want!

## What about redstone sorting systems?
The mod will likely break many storage systems. If you only have one set of repeaters on the lowest setting, I recommend setting the speed to 6 ticks (~3.3 items/second). That is what worked for me on my server. I **highly** recommend testing your storage system with this mod in a creative world to find the right speed that works with your system.

# Plans for the future
* Allow hoppers to move stacks at a time instead of just one item at a time.
* Support multiple MC versions (1.18+?)
* Learn new skills so I can actually do all of this
