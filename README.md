# Fast-Hoppers
It makes hoppers transfer every tick instead of every 8.

#### **IT WILL BREAK SORTED STORAGE SYSTEMS**
I tested it in my server and the repeater caused the redstone to catch up late, it may change depending on your redstone layout for your storage systems. Another note, comparators only activate if a hopper has an item for 2 ticks.

## How does it work?
It injects code to replace the cooldown check of hoppers and always says it can transfer.

## Can I use it in a modpack?
Yes, please use it however you want!

## How long did you spend making this mod?
Probably around 30 minutes once I learned how to make a mod in minecraft. This is my first mod ever, I may try to improve it in the future, the source code is available if you want to help with it.
